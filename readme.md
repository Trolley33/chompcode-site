# [Chompcode](http://chompcode.com/)

This site is to be the holding pen for all projects produced by Chompcode, which includes this one!. The site is custom produced by us here, and makes use of minimal library features for simplicity (pure PHP back-end, jQuery+Bootstrap front-end). We plan to expand this site to be a fully fledged blog + project repository, featuring project pages not disimilar to Github README's, but give a aesthetically pleasing view for anyone wanting to see what we're about.
